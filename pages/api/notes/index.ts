          "Everyone knows how to pass props to react components, but your case is different. You don't really know the component you'll pass as a child/children and you want them to inherit the parent's props. A good use case might be a <Protected/> component. You'll want every child of the component to have access to an isAuthenticated prop. You've even tried something like this...",

          'These are exactly the benefits that learning CS Fundamentals provide you in everyday programming. Even though you\'re not "composing your own algorithms", your knowledge of how computer science works provides a serious boost to your programming ability in general. The difference between music and programming is what exactly is "boosted": While a musician that knows the theory will be better at designing and understanding music, a programmer who knows the theory will be better at designing and understanding systems. A person who doesn\'t know programming theory is perfectly capable of creating a good product from the user point of view, but it\'s likely that they will be severely hindered from a system design point of view.',

Note that correctly doesn't mean \"this code must use this ultra-fast obscure algorithm a Russian man published in 1970, otherwise it's wrong\", it simply means that the code you're writing makes sense from an engineering standpoint. I'm gonna say it again: Stop thinking that the fundamentals are only about coding obscure algorithms!",
