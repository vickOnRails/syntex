# Syntex

Syntex is a self-hosted, open source web application for storing notes from the internet all in one place.

## Why I'm building syntex

There're lots of life changing articles on the internet. When I come accross one, I don't ever want to loose it. I quickly write about them on my blog. I thought it would be cool to build a site to store all these notes together.

I thought it would also be nice to have a browser extension so it makes it easy to collect these little notes. I hope there're people like who'll find this project useful too.
